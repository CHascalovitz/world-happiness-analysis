           <h2>About</h2>
           <p>
            Welcome to my GitHub project showcasing my data science skills! My name is Sorina, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in population health at the University of Ottawa. With a background in film and TV, I've always been drawn to storytelling, but my passion for wealth inequality and mental health led me to pivot towards data-driven research. This project dives into the World Happiness Report, examining key factors impacting global well-being. 
            <br><br>
            Using data sourced from Kaggle and The World Bank, I explored various dimensions of happiness, including the correlation between happiness scores and economic inequality measured by the Gini index. Additionally, I investigated the role of generosity as a potential mediator in the relationship between economic inequality and happiness. Through insightful analyses and engaging visualizations, I aim to shed light on pressing societal issues while showcasing my proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques.
            <br><br>
            Join me on this journey as we uncover meaningful insights from the data and work towards building a happier, more equitable world. </p>

           <h2>Data Source</h2>
           <H4>The dataset for the World Happiness Report was downloaded from <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness/>Kaggle</a> and the dataset for the Gini Coefficient from <a href=https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/gender-statistics/series/SI.POV.GINI#:~:text=See%20the%20Poverty%20and%20Inequality,pip.worldbank.org).>The World Bank</a>.</H4>
           <p> The WHS is based on surveys conducted by Gallup World Poll. These surveys ask people from various countries to rate their subjective well-being and happiness based on different factors such as income, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and healthy life expectancy. The data is then compiled and analyzed to produce the World Happiness Report, which ranks countries based on their happiness scores and provides insights into factors influencing happiness levels globally.</p>
           <H4>The database includes data from 156 countries from 2019.</H4>
           <H4>There are eight datasets:</H4>
           <li>World Happiness Score</li>
           <li>GDP per Capita</li>
           <li>Social Support</li>
           <li>Healthy Life Expectancy</li>
           <li>Freedom to Make Life Choices</li>
           <li>Generosity</li>
           <li>Perceptions of Corruption</li>
